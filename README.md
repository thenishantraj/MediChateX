# Medicine App

The **Medicine App** is a full-stack application designed to manage **medicine prescriptions**, **patient data**, and **ML-powered predictions**. It consists of:
- A **Flask backend** for handling API requests, integrating machine learning models, and managing patient data.
- A **React.js frontend** for the web, providing a user-friendly interface to interact with the backend.
- A **React Native mobile app** that allows users to access the platform from their mobile devices.

## Features

- **Patient Management**: Add, update, and view patient records.
- **Medicine Prediction**: Use machine learning to recommend medication based on the patientâ€™s data.
- **Multi-platform Support**: Accessible via a web app (React.js) and mobile app (React Native).
- **User Authentication**: Login and Signup functionality for both web and mobile users.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Flask, Python, SQLite, Machine Learning (e.g., Scikit-Learn)
- **Frontend**: React.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- **Mobile App**: React Native, JavaScript
- **Database**: SQLite
- **Containerization**: Docker, Docker Compose

## Backend

The backend is built using **Flask**, a lightweight Python framework. It includes an **API** for managing patient data, user authentication, and medicine predictions, powered by a machine learning model.

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo_url>
   cd medicine-app/backend

- **app.py**: This is the main Flask application file that handles API requests. It includes routes for user authentication, managing patient records, and recommending medicines using the trained ML model.
  
- **train_model.py**: This script trains the machine learning model using patient data and saves it as `medicine_model.pkl`. The model predicts recommended medicines based on user input.

- **medicine_model.pkl**: The trained machine learning model. It is used by the backend to make predictions on the user's data and recommend relevant medicines.

- **label_encoder.pkl**: The label encoder is used to convert categorical data (e.g., symptoms or conditions) into numerical data that the machine learning model can understand.

- **patients.db**: An SQLite database that stores patient records, including personal details and medical history. This data is used by the backend to make more personalized recommendations.

- **requirements.txt**: This file contains all the Python dependencies required for the backend, including Flask, Scikit-learn, and SQLite.

- **README.md** (Backend): The documentation for the backend, explaining how to set up, run, and interact with the backend.

## Frontend

The frontend is a **React.js** web application that provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the backend API. It is designed to manage patient records, perform user authentication, and display the recommended medicines.

### Directory Structure

- **public/**: This folder contains static assets like `index.html`, logos, and other images required for the frontend.

- **src/**: This folder contains the source code for the React application.

  - **components/**: This subfolder contains reusable React components that make up different pages and sections of the application.
    - **Login.js**: The component responsible for the login page where users can authenticate.
    - **Signup.js**: The component responsible for the signup page where new users can register.
    - **Navbar.js**: The component that defines the navigation bar used across the app.
    - **Home.js**: The main page where users can input their symptoms to get medicine recommendations.
    - **Results.js**: This page displays the recommended medicines based on the user's input.

  - **App.js**: This is the root component that serves as the main container for the application.

  - **App.css**: The CSS file responsible for styling the React app.

  - **index.js**: The entry point of the React app, where it connects to the DOM and renders the app.

- **package.json**: This file lists the Node.js dependencies required for the frontend, such as React and React Router.

- **README.md** (Frontend): Documentation for setting up and running the React.js frontend.

### Setup

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend

Install Node.js dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
Start the React app:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm start
This will launch the web application at http://localhost:3000.

Mobile App
The mobile app is built using React Native, which allows the platform to be accessible on both Android and iOS devices. It provides similar functionality as the web app but with a mobile-optimized interface.

Directory Structure
App.js: The main entry point for the React Native app.

components/: Contains shared components used across the mobile app.

Login.js: Allows users to log into their accounts.
Signup.js: Allows new users to sign up.
Home.js: Displays the input form for symptoms to generate medicine recommendations.
Results.js: Shows the recommended medicines based on user input.
package.json: This file lists all Node.js dependencies required for React Native development.

README.md (Mobile App): Documentation for setting up and running the React Native mobile app.

Setup
Navigate to the mobile-app directory:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd mobile-app
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
Run the app for Android or iOS:

For iOS:
bash
Copy
Edit
npx react-native run-ios
For Android:
bash
Copy
Edit
npx react-native run-android
Docker Setup
To run the backend and database using Docker, follow these steps to containerize the application.

Dockerfile: This file contains instructions to build the Docker image for the backend API. It specifies the Python environment, dependencies, and how to run the Flask app.

docker-compose.yml: The Docker Compose file allows you to run the backend and database in separate containers. It defines the services required to run the backend and the SQLite database.

Setup
Build the Docker images:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker-compose build
Start the Docker containers:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker-compose up
This will start the backend API and database in separate containers. The backend will be accessible at http://localhost:5000.
